<h1>Statement Of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>Cockroach infestations remain a persistent challenge in households, commercial establishments, and food storage facilities due to the pests’ adaptability, rapid reproduction, and ability to spread harmful pathogens. Conventional chemical-based control methods, while effective, introduce significant health and environmental risks. There is a need for an innovative, sustainable, and non-toxic approach that targets cockroach reproductive behavior—particularly the deposition of oothecae in hidden, undisturbed areas. This study seeks to address the problem by developing and testing a piezoelectric ceramic disc–based flooring system capable of generating low-frequency vibrations to deter cockroach egg-laying and reduce infestation rates without harming humans, pets, or the environment.
