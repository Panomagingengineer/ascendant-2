<h1>Methodology</h1> <hr>
<p>The prototype flooring system was developed using piezoelectric ceramic discs arranged in a modular wooden housing measuring approximately 22 × 14 inches. High-density foam layers were placed inside the housing to distribute applied weight and enhance mechanical coupling. Fifty-four piezoelectric ceramic discs mounted on brass plates were connected to a full-wave bridge rectifier using 1N4148 diodes.
