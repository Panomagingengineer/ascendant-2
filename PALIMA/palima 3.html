<h1>Methodology</h1> <hr>
<p>The prototype flooring system was developed using piezoelectric ceramic discs arranged in a modular wooden housing measuring approximately 22 × 14 inches. High-density foam layers were placed inside the housing to distribute applied weight and enhance mechanical coupling. Fifty-four piezoelectric ceramic discs mounted on brass plates were connected to a full-wave bridge rectifier using 1N4148 diodes.
The rectified electrical output was stored in a capacitor bank ranging from 10 μF to 9500 μF and periodically discharged to power miniature vibration drivers embedded in the flooring. These drivers produced controlled low-frequency vibrations designed to deter cockroach ootheca deposition while remaining imperceptible to humans. A small lead-acid battery was included to stabilize power supply during periods of low foot traffic.
Rubber pads were installed beneath the unit to minimize noise and improve durability. The system was tested using simulated foot traffic with varying loads, and electrical output and vibration frequency were recorded. The effectiveness of the vibrations in deterring Periplaneta americana ootheca deposition was evaluated under controlled conditions.
