<p>It is recommended that future studies conduct long-term field testing of the piezoelectric flooring system in actual household and commercial environments to evaluate its effectiveness under real-world conditions. Further optimization of vibration frequency and intensity should be performed to achieve maximum deterrence while maintaining human comfort and energy efficiency. Integrating the system with other non-chemical pest control methods, such as improved sanitation and physical barriers, may enhance overall effectiveness. Additionally, improvements in system durability and cost-efficiency are necessary to support large-scale production and practical implementation. Lastly, future research should investigate the system’s effectiveness against other cockroach species to determine its broader applicability in pest management.
