  Janitor fish skin is expected to exhibit adequate tensile strength, good flexibility, and moderate resistance to frictional wear compared to traditional leather. While traditional leather may show higher durability overall, janitor fish skin is anticipated to perform within acceptable ranges for practical use. These results would support the potential of janitor fish skin as a sustainable alternative material and promote the utilization of an invasive species.
