<h1>Statement Of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>
  Traditional leather production has significant environmental impacts, creating a need for sustainable alternative materials. Janitor fish (Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus), an invasive species in the Marikina River, may offer a potential alternative through the utilization of its skin.
However, limited studies have quantitatively evaluated the durability and performance of janitor fish skin compared to traditional leather. This study aims to determine whether janitor fish skin differs significantly from traditional leather in terms of tensile strength, flexibility, and friction-wear resistance, and to assess its viability as an alternative leather material.
