  it is recommended that janitor fish skin be further explored as a sustainable alternative to traditional leather. Manufacturers and designers can consider using treated janitor fish skin for fashion and accessory applications, particularly for products that do not require extremely high durability. Additionally, further research should investigate large-scale processing methods, alternative treatments to improve wear resistance, and the environmental benefits of utilizing an invasive species for material production.
