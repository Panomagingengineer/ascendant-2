<h1>Statement of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>This study investigates how Xanthomonas campestris spreads in okra over time and under varying conditions. It aims to measure infection rate, map lesion patterns, assess effects on plant health, identify the most vulnerable growth stage, and determine environmental factors like humidity and temperature that influence disease spread. The study addresses the lack of quantitative and visual data on bacterial infections in okra.
