<p>All inoculated okra plants developed visible symptoms of Xanthomonas campestris infection. Lesion expansion was faster under high humidity (70–90%) and higher temperatures (30–35 °C). Younger plants (2 weeks old) showed earlier symptom appearance and greater lesion spread compared to older plants. Spatiotemporal image analysis confirmed that lesions expanded outward from inoculation points over time, with more severe growth reduction and leaf yellowing observed in heavily infected plants.
