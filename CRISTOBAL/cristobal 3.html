<h1>Methodology </h1> <hr>
<p> This study used an experimental design to assess the spatiotemporal spread of Xanthomonas campestris in okra under varied humidity, temperature, and plant age. Thirty okra seedlings (young, mid-growth, and mature) were inoculated with a standardized bacterial suspension. Daily images of leaf lesions were captured using a fixed setup and analyzed with image processing software to quantify lesion size and spread over time. Environmental variables were monitored, and plant growth impacts were recorded to relate disease progression to conditions. Standard safety protocols were followed during bacterial handling and disposal..
