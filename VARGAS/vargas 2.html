<h1>Statement of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>Haiti’s exchange rate has exhibited persistent volatility driven by financial fragility, weak institutions, and recurring macroeconomic shocks. Existing studies focus mainly on exchange rate levels and inflation dynamics, with limited attention to volatility and structural regime changes. This gap limits understanding of how macroeconomic factors and institutional fragility jointly influence exchange rate instability and constrains effective policy design.
