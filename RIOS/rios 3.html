<h1>Methodology</h1> <hr>
<p> The study employed an experimental design to test a floodwater-depth sensing flashlight equipped with an Arduino, ultrasonic and turbidity sensors, LED light, and LCD display. Water depths of 5–25 cm were tested under clear, low, and high turbidity conditions, with three trials per condition. Depth readings from the device were compared to actual measurements using a ruler to assess accuracy.
